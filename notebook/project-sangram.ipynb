Harvey, Stuart I. Hodgetts, and K. Swaminathan Iyer* Central nervous system (CNS) injuries and neurodegenerative diseases have markedly poor prognoses and can result in permanent dysfunction due to the general inability of CNS neurons to regenerate.\n",
      "Differentiation of transplanted stem cells has emerged as a therapeutic avenue to regenerate tissue architecture in damaged areas.\n",
      "Electrical stimulation is a promising approach for directing the differentiation outcomes and pattern of outgrowth of transplanted stem cells, however traditional inorganic bio-electrodes can induce adverse effects such as inflammation.\n",
      "This study demonstrates the implementation of two organic thin films, a polymer/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (P(rGO)) and PEDOT:PSS, that have favorable properties for implementation as conductive materials for electrical stimulation, as well as an inorganic indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive film.\n",
