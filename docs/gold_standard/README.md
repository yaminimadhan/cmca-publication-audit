# Gold Standard Dataset – CMCA Publication Audit

This folder contains the Gold Standard dataset (final Excel) and supporting codebooks.

## Files

- **Gold_Standard_Codebook_v2.docx** – Final, Excel-aligned codebook with column definitions, coding rules, decision tree, and worked examples.  
- **Gold_Standard_v1.xlsx** – Final dataset (30/30 cases, PDF verified).  
- **codebook_v1.md** – Earlier draft kept for transparency (superseded by v2).

## Notes
- Use **Codebook v2** for all current and future work.
- v1 shows the initial approach but should not be used for analysis.
