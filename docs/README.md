# Documentation – CMCA Publication Audit

This folder contains documentation for the Gold Standard dataset.

- **codebook_v1.md**  
  Initial codebook covering the first 20/30 cases.  
  Defines fields, coding rules, and includes examples.  
  Status: Work in progress, to be updated after PDF verification and negative case inclusion.

- **Future versions**  
  - v2: Full 30/30 cases, adjudicated decisions, negative cases.  
  - v3: Final polished codebook with edge case guidelines.

⚠️ Note: The Excel file (`Gold_Standard_Draft20of30.xlsx`) is not the final dataset.  
It’s a partial draft to track progress only.
