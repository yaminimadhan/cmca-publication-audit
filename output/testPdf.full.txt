ABSTRACT: This study focuses on enhancing sustainability
through energy-efficient methods in producing hierarchically
structured porous carbons. A novel approach, utilizing an ultrasonic
spray nozzle-quartz tube reactor (USN-QTR), is introduced for
fabricating carbon beads with customizable ultra-, super-, and
mesopores. This study showcases noteworthy results from
subjecting spherical char particles to activation processes involving
carbon dioxide, a mixture of carbon dioxide and micron-sized water
droplets, and highly concentrated supercritical steam at a temper-
ature of 1173 K for durations of 3 and 5 h. Through pulse-field
gradient nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, it was noted
that carbon beads produced using USN-generated highly con-
centrated supercritical steam displayed remarkably elevated intra-
bead self-diffusivity of n-hexane. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy demonstrates superior gold recovery
kinetics from cyanide solutions compared to that from an industrial benchmark. The energy expenditure for USN-generated steam,
producing carbon beads with an apparent surface area of 2691 m2/g, is estimated at 97 J per 1 m2 of carbon. This contrasts with the
traditional steam generation method requiring approximately the energy of 190 J/m2 for activated carbon with an SBET of 2130 m2/g,
making the USN-assisted activation method a more environmentally friendly and sustainable option with nearly half the energy
consumption.

■INTRODUCTION
Nanoporous carbons have been widely and predominantly
applied to green technologies.1−10 One of the critical challenges
in the production of nanoporous carbons is to achieve high-
quality nanoporous carbons while minimizing energy con-
sumption. The traditional energy-intensive activation methods
do not align well with green technology.11,12 It is necessary to
innovate the production of nanoporous carbons having
customized characteristics with less energy. One promising
approach to achieve this is by leveraging the capabilities of an
ultrasonic spray nozzle (USN), which has the potential to
produce high-quality carbons while reducing energy consump-
tion.
USN technology is an emerging technology that has found
extensive applications in various fields, including spray coating,
fabrication of nanoparticles, and synthesis of functional
nanomaterials and catalysts.13−18 A USN is a low-power
consumption device that operates by converting high-frequency
standing waves into mechanical energy, which is then transferred
into a liquid. USN technology has the potential to accelerate and
precisely control the activation process of char. This is achieved
by generating highly concentrated supercritical steam with
uniform micrometer-sized droplets, which are sprayed directly
into a quartz tube reactor without the need for a carrier gas. This
innovative approach can lead to the production of high-quality
nanoporous carbons. The use of USN-aided activation offers
significant advantages over traditional char activation that relies
on a water-heating process conducted outside a reactor to
produce steam. The steam is subsequently combined with a
carrier gas through a bubbling process and transported to the
reactor.11 The need to sustain high temperatures for the steam
entails additional energy consumption to operate ribbon heaters

or heating tapes. Moreover, the utilization of USN-aided
activation is suitable for producing nanoporous carbons with
customized pore structures, including hierarchical nanoporous
activated carbons.19,20 As far as we are aware, the integration of a
USN into char activation processes has not been explored in
previous research.
Hierarchical pore-structured carbon beads produced from
ion-exchange resin beads possess numerous advantageous
characteristics that make them highly suitable for a wide range
of applications. These advantages include high level of chemical
purity, good fluidity and packaging, a smooth outer surface
topology, high mechanical strength, resistance to abrasion and
dust formation, and the ability to customize surface area and
porosity to meet specific requirments.20,21 These applications
encompass a broad range of uses and are not restricted to
extracorporeal detoxification, hemo- and enterosorption,
alleviating chemotherapy side effects, extracting precious metals
from low-grade ore through adsorption from cyanide solutions,
and catalyst support.20−27 To ensure both high chemical purity
and precise control over the hierarchical pore structure of
carbon beads, it is crucial to develop and construct innovative
reactors for char activation that eliminate the requirement for
external chemical activating agents. To improve both energy and
water efficiency in the activation process that utilizes steam, it is
imperative to reduce the costs associated with steam production
and its transportation. This can be achieved by adopting state-of-
the-art USN technology, which offers a promising solution for
cost reduction without compromising the steam utilization
performance.
In this study, we developed and built an ultrasonic spray
nozzle-quartz tube reactor (USN-QTR) for char activation. We
applied the USN-QTR to produce two series of hierarchical
pore-structured carbon beads (HPSCBs) through activation
processes lasting 3 and 5 h. These processes included CO2
activation, ultrasonically generated micron-sized water droplets
injected with CO2 activation, and highly concentrated super-
critical steam activation without the use of a carrier gas (Table 1
and Figure 1). The impact of alterations in accessible and
inaccessible pore volume and surface area fractions, pore size
distributions, and intrabead self-diffusivity of n-hexane is
examined through high-resolution nitrogen adsorption, small-
and wide-angle X-ray scattering, and pulse-field gradient nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the context of an
industrially relevant problem, we have examined the impact of
USN-assisted activation on the kinetics of gold dicyanide
recovery. This investigation was conducted using inductively

aThe burn-off was determined using the sample weights before and after activation. The production yield was calculated by comparing the weight
of the dry precursor sample to the weight of the dry carbon sample. The error in the burn-off degree and production yield is calculated as the
standard deviation derived from three repeated experiments.

coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The
energy cost of steam generation using a USN and water heating
for the production of 1 m2 of the apparent BET surface area has
been estimated and thoroughly discussed.
■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Synthesis. HPSCBs were prepared through a two-step activation
process, with carbonization performed as a separate step followed by
activation. The carbon precursor employed consisted of beads of an
acidic, macroporous cation exchange resin synthesized from a styrene-
divinylbenzene copolymer (mean bead size = 670 ± 50 μm, SBET = 15
m2/g, Vp = 0.144 cm3/g, and an average pore size D = 32.72 nm) and
supplied by Lewatit MonoPlus SP 112 H, Lanxess Pty Ltd. (Germany).
High-purity N2 and CO2 gases were procured from BOC Gas
(Australia). The Reverse Osmosis (4 stages, IBIS Technology,
Australia) and Milli-Q Reference Water Purification System were
used to produce deionized water (18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C).
The carbonization process involved taking approximately 2 grams of
the polymeric precursor and placing it in a ceramic crucible. The
crucible containing the sample was placed into a reactor and then
heated to a temperature of 803 K for a duration of 2 hours. Nitrogen gas
was employed as a carrier gas at a flow rate of around 2.0 dm3/min
(Figure 1(a)). The result of this carbonization process was
approximately 82% weight-loss of the precursor, which was determined
by measuring the sample’s weight before and after carbonization.
Following carbonization, approximately 1 g of the resulting char was
subjected to the activation process. The activation method and specific
parameters used can be found in Table 1 and are schematically shown in
Figure 1.
An ultrasonic cone-shaped spray nozzle operating at 120 kHz (Sono-
Tek Corp., USA) and set to a constant power of 3.0 W was employed
for the generation of micrometer-sized water droplets (Figure 1(b)).
Deionized water was delivered at a constant flow rate of 0.2 cm3/min
through a Teflon tube measuring 0.45 m in length with an inner
diameter 0.96 mm, facilitated by a syringe pump. It is important to note
that the activation process with highly concentrated supercritical steam
was accomplished by continually injecting water droplets generated by
the USN directly into the quartz tube reactor without the need for a
carrier gas flow (see movies in the Supporting Information). The
concentration of supercritical steam was gradually increased in a
controlled manner over 3 and 5 h, as illustrated in the bottom panel of
Figure 1(c). After 5 h of activation at 1173 K, the estimated density of
supercritical steam within the quartz tube reactor is approximately
0.031 g/cm3.
Low-Temperature Nitrogen Adsorption and Scanning
Electron Microscopy. The porosity of both the char and HPSCBs
was evaluated by using nitrogen adsorption−desorption isotherms at 77
K (Tristar II 3020, Micromeritics, USA). Prior to the measurements,
the samples were subject to vacuum degassing at 473 K for 24 h. The
pore size distributions (PSDs) and textural characteristics were assessed
using the quenched solid density functional theory (QSDFT)
method.28−30 A mixed slit and cylindrical kernel was used to model
equilibrium nitrogen adsorption in micro- and mesopores, respec-
tively.28−30 The apparent Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface
areas were determined by analyzing the nitrogen adsorption isotherms
within a relative pressure range of 0.05−0.3 (Table S1). Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) observations and the energy-dispersive X-
ray (EDX) analyses of carbon samples were conducted using a Verios
XHR SEM system at the Centre for Microscopy, Characterization, and
Analysis (CMCA) at the UWA. A slow-curing transparent epoxy known
as EpoFix was prepared by combining the resin and hardener in a
weight ratio of 25:3, respectively. Subsequently, carbon beads were
introduced into a 25 mm diameter mounting cup named FixiForm
along with the epoxy. The combined mixture was subjected to a vacuum
within a desiccator for a minimum duration of 24 h. Following this, the
epoxy molds containing the carbon beads underwent a polishing
process to reveal the interior of the beads. Subsequently, they were
coated with carbon before being imaged by SEM.
Small-Angle and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering Measure-
ments. Combined small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle
X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns were collected using a Nano-inXider
instrument from Xenocs SAS (Grenoble, France) with Cu Kα radiation
and a two-detector setup for simultaneous measurements of the SAXS
and WAXS. Both detectors are Pilatus 300 k pixel detectors from
Dectris (Baden, Switzerland). The scattering intensity is a function of
the wavevector magnitude q = 4π sin(θ)/λ, with a specific value of X-ray
wavelength λ = 0.154 nm being used in this study. The samples were
loaded into vacuum-tight containers and sealed with 5−7 μm thick mica
windows. Each measurement was conducted under a vacuum, with an
acquisition time of 60 min. Standard reduction software (XSACT) was
used to average and correct the two-dimensional scattering data to yield
the data curves. The 1D SAXS and WAXS data were merged into a
single scattering curve, and the background from the mica windows was
subtracted (Figure S1). The theoretical treatment of the SAXS data is
described in detail in Supporting Information, Section 1. The standard
X-ray scattering diffraction analysis was conducted using a Rigaku
SmartLab instrument equipped with a HyPix-3000 detector. The X-ray
source used was Cu Kα with a wavelength of 0.154 nm. The analysis
covered the angular range 10−90° (2θ) with a step of 0.01° (2θ) and a
scanning speed of 4°/min. A silicon zero diffraction holder was used for
the measurements (Figure S2). The spacing between the graphite layers
was determined using the Bragg equation31 (Table S1).
PFG NMR Diffusion Measurements. For NMR diffusion analysis,
the samples were prepared by immersing ∼1.5 g in excess n-hexane
(>98%, Sigma-Aldrich). These samples were sealed tightly in 5 mm
NMR tubes (Bruker BioSpin) and left to soak for a minimum of 48 h.
The
1H pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements were
conducted by using a Magritek Spinsolve Diffusion spectrometer
(Magritek, New Zealand) equipped with a cylindrical 1 T Halbach
magnet array, providing a 1H NMR frequency of 43 MHz. The
measurements were carried out at the default spectrometer temperature
of 301 K. Before analysis, all samples were allowed to reach thermal
equilibrium with the magnet bore for at least 20 min.
The diffusion of both unrestricted and imbibed n-hexane was
analyzed using the pulsed gradient stimulated echo (PGSTE) sequence,
as depicted in Figure 2. The self-diffusion coefficient of unrestricted n-
hexane (D0) was determined by fitting the acquired signal attenuation
data at low b-factor to32

pulse duration and observation time, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.
A short Δ time of 20 ms was required to obtain an adequate NMR signal
in the presence of very short relaxation times, which arises from the
confinement of our n-hexane probe in carbon micropores.
The data collected from samples containing both char and carbon
beads immersed in excess n-hexane were fitted using a biexponential

calculated from fitting eq 3 to the experimental data. The details of the
parameters used in the PGSTE measurements and the model used for
fitting eq 3 can be found in Table S2 and Section 2 of the Supporting
Information.
Kinetic Performance of Hierarchical Pore-Structured Carbon
Beads. Measurements of the Au recovery from cyanide solutions on
HPSCB samples were conducted to examine how the hierarchical pore
structures of carbon beads affect the kinetics of adsorption. Coconut
shell-based steam-activated carbon (Acticarb GC25PAU, Activated
Carbon Technologies Pty Ltd., Australia) was used as an industry
benchmark. The Acticarb sample used for comparison was selected to
have a size fraction in the range of approximately 351−500 μm. This
choice was made to ensure that the granules of Acticarb would be
similar in size to those of the produced HPSCBs, facilitating a more
meaningful comparison. The carbon was initially ground by using a
mortar and pestle and then sieved to obtain the desired size fraction. A
gold standard solution with a concentration of 1 g/dm3 was obtained
from PerkinElmer (Glen Waverley, Vic, AUS). High-purity potassium
dicyanoaurate(I) (K[Au(Cn)2]), with a purity of 98%, and ACS grade
Potassium Cyanide (KCN) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich
(Truganina, Vic, AUS). The measurements using inductively coupled
plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) were conducted
using a Thermo Scientific iCAP 7000 series instrument, specifically the
model 7600. The ICP-OES spectrometer was operated with the
following parameters: RF power, 1150 kW; auxiliary gas (Ar) flow, 0.5
dm3/min; nebulizer gas (Ar) flow, 0.5 dm3/min; exposure time, 15 s;
orientation, axial only; frequency, 500 Hz; replicates, 3. The
wavelengths selected for measuring Au metal ions were 242.795 and
267.595 nm. The 1 g/dm3 Au standard solution was diluted to
concetrations 10, 5, 2, and 1 mg/dm3, and these solutions were to create
the calibration curve. The calibration curve yielded a determination
coefficient of 0.999 for both Au wavelengths. The solution matrix used
for both the standards and the sample solutions was 0.2% HCl. A stock
feed solution of 500.0 mg/dm3 Au was prepared using 0.7315 g of
K[Au(Cn)2] with 12.5 g of KCN and NaOH. The pH of the stock feed
was adjusted to 2. This stock feed was used to prepare a 500 cm3
solution with a concentration of 10.0 mg/dm3 for each carbon sample.
An aggregate of 2 cm3 was taken from each solution before inserting the
carbons and used as a 0 min reference. Approximately 0.125 g of carbon
materials wasplaced in a beaker with a magnetic stirrer and maintained
at 24 °C. At various time intervals (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100,
120, 240, 480, 1440, and 2880 min), a 10 cm3 sample was collected from

■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Morphological Changes. The discussion focuses on
morphological changes in HPSCB samples activated at 1173
K for 5 h. HPSCBs activated at 1173 K for 3 h exhibit a
morphology that closely resembles that of char. Figure 3 displays
secondary (SE) and backscattered electron (BSE) images of
char and HPSCB-H2O-5h. SEM images collected for HPSCB-
CO2-5h, HPSCB-CO2/H2O-5h, and corresponding energy-
dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectra are shown in Section 3,
Supporting Information (Figures S4−S7). The activation
method does not affect the relative concentrations of S, O,
and C (e.g., S is ∼2.3 ± 0.3 wt %, the content of O is ∼2.1 ± 0.7
wt %, and C is a dominant element with a relative concentration
of ∼95.5 ± 0.6 wt %). Notably, microscopic observations
indicate that each of the carbon beads produced exhibited a rim
approximately 10 to 25 μm thick, encircling the core. No rim was
detected in the char. Although all carbon beads preserved their
external shape, the boundary/interface between the rim and core
exhibited variations. HPSCB-CO2-5h and HPSCB-CO2/H2O-
5h both exhibited a distinct interface between the rim and the
core, whereas the HPSCB-H2O-5h displayed larger embayment
areas. Without additional characterization, it is not possible to
definitively attribute these embayments to the activation
process.
An in-depth analysis of the structural characteristics of the rim
and the associated parameters is beyond the scope of this paper.
However, it seems imperative to conduct additional research to
determine whether there are any differences between the rim
and the core. Discrepancies in characteristics such as porosity,
density, hardness, or permeability between these two regions
hold intriguing potential for modulating adsorption and
desorption kinetics.
Figures 4 and S8 illustrate the particle size distribution
(PaSD) derived from the SAXS data. These distributions pertain
to HPSCB samples activated at 1173 K for 5 (a-c) and 3 h using
various activation methods, as well as char (d). Based on the
count and locations of the peaks, we can conclude that both char
and the produced HPSCB exhibit a distinctive three-level
hierarchical structure.36−40 The initial prominent symmetrical
peak at ∼1−10 nm is ascribed to graphene nanoclusters.36−40
Subsequent WAXS analysis verified the existence of turbostratic

graphene clusters, characterized by an average interlayer
distance of d002 = 0.411−0.476 nm (Table S1 and Figure S2).
The second major peak in the range of about 10−50 nm arises
from coherent scattering by nanoparticles.36−40 The ∼10−40
nm peak for HPSCB-H2O-5h is broadened rather than a
symmetrical bell-shaped one (Figure 4). This suggests that the
excessive burnoff of char by highly concentrated supercritical
steam may lead to a more uniform distribution of nanoparticle
sizes. The third level of particulate hierarchy pertains to
aggregates of nanoparticles, with sizes that can be accessed via
SAXS, reaching up to 500 nm.36−40 On this level, three peaks
were discerned, with char exhibiting the highest intensity and
HPSCB-H2O-5h displaying the lowest. This suggests that the
activation method has a relatively minor effect on the structure
of nanoparticle aggregates.
Accessible Pore Structure Changes. Figure 5 shows the
nitrogen adsorption−desorption isotherms measured at 77 K for
char and HPSCBs activated at 1173 K for 3 and (a, b) 5 h (c, d).
The N2 adsorption−desorption isotherms confirm that all
samples have a hierarchical structure of a microporous matrix
with embedded mesopore channels. Adsorption in micropores
(typically smaller 1 nm) at low pressures (p/p0 < 0.1) is
characterized by a sharp concave isotherm of type 1(a),41 while
adsorption in mesopores is characterized by a well-pronounced
hysteresis loop at p/p0 > 0.8. The initial part of the isotherm on
the HPSCB-H2O-3h sample is of type 1(b) that corresponds to
carbons with larger micropores and possible narrow mesopores
(<2.5 nm). Except for char, the H1-type adsorption−desorption
hysteresis loops of similar shape are closed at higher relative
pressures with no evidence of cavitation.41,42 The nitrogen
adsorption−desorption isotherms’ reproducibility was validated
through independent measurements conducted on three
separate carbon samples (Figures S9−S11). The adsorption
and desorption isotherm for char exhibit partial irreversibility at
low pressures, suggesting kinetic limitations in the transport of
nitrogen molecules from the exterior to the pores. Additionally, a
weak swelling of the char filled with nitrogen is feasible. Detailed
examination of the PSD and the contributions of pore volume/
surface area from micro- and mesopores (Figures 6−7 and Table
2) highlights the substantial benefits of USN-assisted activation
using highly concentrated supercritical steam. These benefits are
particularly evident in terms of the increased accessible surface
area and porosity.
The HPSCP-CO2-3h sample, produced using traditional
activation with pure CO2, is characterized by a sharp PSD with
an ultramicropore (<0.7 nm in width) fraction accounting for
93% of the accessible surface area, as indicated in Table 2. The
mesopore volume fraction (ranging from 2 to 50 nm in width),
at 41 vol % suggests that certain mesopores in the char have been
opened by CO2. The introduction of micrometer-sized water
droplets to the CO2 carrier gas via USN injection leads to
significant changes in PSD, as depicted in Figure 6. The primary
peak in the PSD at 0.8 nm becomes broader as a result. The
majority of the accessible surface area, comprising 78%, can be
attributed to supermicropores (ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 nm in
width), while the volume fraction of accessible mesopores stands
at 38 vol % (Table 2). This increase in the fraction of
supermicropores can be explained by the merging of ultra-
micropore walls and the simultaneous formation of new
supermicropores from the early stages of the activation
process.43,44
The HPSCB-H2O-3h sample produced through activation
with USN-generated highly concentrated supercritical steam,
showcases the highest accessible pore volume (0.88 cm3/g) and
accessible surface area (1272 m2/g). These values are in line
with the highest char burnoff observed after 3 h of activation, as
detailed in Table 1. The PSD exhibits a broad peak at 0.9 nm,
accompanied by a distinct shoulder at 1.4 nm. Interestingly, the
fractions of accessible surface area attributed to ultra-, super-,
and mesopores closely resemble those of HPSCB-CO2/H2O-3h
(Table 2).
As we will demonstrate later, this outcome can be attributed
to the relatively short duration of the activation process.
Interestingly, extending the time of CO2 activation from 3 to 5 h
does not yield significant changes in the PSD or the
corresponding fractions of accessible surface area and accessible
pore volume (Figures 6−7 and Table 2). Hence, our conclusion
is that the traditional 3 and 5 h of CO2 activation of char at 1173
K is not sufficient for the alteration of the pore structure.
Likewise, there is no significant alteration in the pore structure
when extending the activation time from 3 to 5 h for carbon
beads produced using CO2 enriched with USN-generated
micron-sized water droplets.
In contrast, subjecting char to 5 h of activation with USN-
generated highly concentrated supercritical steam at 1173 K
results in a substantial change in the nitrogen adsorption−
desorption isotherm, PSD, and accessible surface/volume ratio

of ultra-, super-, and mesopores, as evidenced by Figures 6−7
and Table 2. The linear shape of nitrogen adsorption isotherm
for HPSCB-H2O-5h at very low pressures (∼10−5−10−3 p/p0)
serves as an indicator of the structural disorder present in the
pore walls (Figure 5).45 The presence of linear segments on the
nitrogen adsorption isotherm suggests the organization of pores
into clusters. Indeed, the PSD calculated for HPSCB-H2O-5h
reveals the presence of four broad and asymmetric peaks,
signifying pore clusters centered at 0.9, 1.8, 3.5, and 18 nm (as
shown in Figure 6). The substantial accessible pore volume
(1.88 cm3/g) and accessible surface area (1967 m2/g) of
HPSCB-H2O-5h were finely tuned. The majority of the
accessible surface area, at 53%, is attributed to supermicropores,
followed by a 44% contribution from mesopores, while the
contribution from ultramicropores is negligible (Table 2). In
terms of accessible volume, mesopores dominate with a 64 vol %
contribution, followed by supermicropores at 34 vol %, and a
minor 2 vol % contribution from ultramicropores, as shown in
Table 2.
Open and Closed Surface Area Changes. The pore size
distributions, extracted from SAXS measurements for char and
HPSCBs activated at 1173 K for 3 and 5 h using various
activation methods (as summarized in Table 1), are presented in
Figure 8. In all carbon samples produced, SAXS PSD features a
broad peak associated with micropores (∼0.4−3.0 nm) and an
asymmetric peak corresponding to mesopores (∼20−40 nm), in
agreement with the QSDFT analysis (Figure 6). Furthermore,
there are discernible additional contributions from large
macropores, ranging from ∼100−200 nm in width. Never-
theless, a careful inspection of SAXS PSDs reveals a diminishing
relative pore volume associated with these ∼100−200 nm
macropores as char burnoff progresses. The enlargement and
coalescence of these macropores, likely facilitated by enhanced
gasification, may account for these observed patterns. It is worth
noting that the relative contributions of open (N2-accessible)
and closed (SAXS data) surface areas are contingent upon both
time and the chosen activation method, as detailed in Table 3.
The inaccessible surface area of char is notably large, reaching
approximately 84%. This high level of inaccessibility is due to the
fact that a significant portion of pores is opened during the
activation process.43,44 Traditional activation with CO2 at 1173
K for 3 to 5 h only manages to open ∼39−41% of the total

surface area, underscoring the inefficiency of this activation
method. The introduction of ultrasonic spraying of micrometer-
sized water droplets to CO2 gas promotes the opening of the
closed surface area in char. Following 5 h of activation with CO2
gas enriched with USN-generated water droplets at 1173 K,
approximately 85% of the total surface area becomes accessible.
The most impressive results are achieved with USN-generated
highly concerted supercritical steam. After 5 h of activation and
enhanced gasification of char at 1173 K using this method, the
contribution from the accessible surface area increased
significantly to 92% (as outlined in Table 3). Notably, this
activation process using USN-generated highly concentrated
supercritical steam does not require the addition of a chemical
activation agent or a carrier gas flow. Moreover, the water
consumption is minimal, totaling 12 cm3 per 60 min of
activation.
Intrabead Transport Properties Changes. Figure 9
presents the experimental PFG NMR signal attenuation curves
of n-hexane-saturated char and HPSCBs activated at 1173 K for
3 (upper panels) and 5 h (bottom panels). Since diffusion rates
appear to be sufficiently separated (as shown in the left panels of
Figure 9), we utilized two independent straight lines to describe
the diffusion data (as expressed in eq 3).46,47 The initial rapid
decay observed is attributed to the unrestricted diffusion of n-
hexane, which moves quickly between carbon beads (referred to
as interbead diffusion, Table 4).46 The subsequent portion of the
attenuation curve reflects the diffusion of n-hexane confined
strictly within the pores (intrabead diffusion, Table 4).46 It is
noteworthy that the uncertainty values for the PFG NMR
interaction parameter, obtained from eq 4, exhibit a range from
approximately ∼±0.2% to 1.1%.
The reduction in n-hexane self-diffusivity within the pores is
attributed to the limited displacement achievable within the
confined carbon nanospaces, as opposed to the more
unrestricted movement in bulk liquid (ηintra > 1, as shown in
Figure 9, right panel). The reduced diffusivity of n-hexane can be
attributed to several factors, including the tortuosity of the pore
network, adsorption interactions occurring at the pore surface,
and activated diffusion through pore constrictions.48 Upon
comparing PFG NMR signal attenuation curves for n-hexane in
saturated char and HPSCB-CO2-3h, it becomes evident that the
intrabead self-diffusion of n-hexane in these samples is highly
similar, as indicated by the ηintra values of 9.5−9.7 (Table 4).
This observation can be rationalized by the notion that char and
HPSCB-CO2-3h share similar pore structures and pore
accessibility characteristics, as detailed in Tables 2 and 3.
Specifically, a short 3-h activation of char with CO2 at 1173 K
does not lead to substantial alterations in the pore network of the
char. Ultrasonic spraying of water droplets onto CO2 gas or
directly into the furnace serves to enhance gasification. As a
consequence, there is a substantial increase in the accessible
porosity, as indicated in Table 2. Hence, self-diffusion of n-
hexane within the pores of HPSCB-CO2/H2O-3h and HPSCB-
H2O-3h is notably hindered (Figure 9 upper panels). In the case
of HPSCB-CO2/H2O-3h, the intrabead self-diffusion parameter
for n-hexane is notably high at 21.7, suggesting severe
restrictions on the self-diffusion of n-hexane molecules within
the pores. However, when USN-assisted activation with highly
concentrated supercritical steam is utilized, which encourages
the development of open porosity with a substantial fraction of
accessible surface area and pore volume in the mesopores, the
intraparticle intrabead self-diffusion parameter for n-hexane is
reduced to 14.5. This reduction indicates an enhanced
connectivity of the hierarchical pore network within HPSCB-
H2O-3h compared to HPSCB-CO2/H2O-3h.
The extended 5-h activation of char with CO2 at 1173 K
primarily results in the formation of ultramicropores (Table 2
and Figures 6-7). As expected, the intrabead self-diffusion of n-
hexane within this sample is considerably impeded, with an
interaction parameter of ηintra of 23.8. The introduction of water
droplets into CO2 gas via ultrasonic spraying over a 5-h period
enhances the self-diffusion of n-hexane within carbon pores,
resulting in a reduction of the interaction parameter ηintra to 16.7.
The highest intrabead diffusivity of n-hexane (ηintra = 9.0) was
achieved in the HPSCB-H2O-5h sample, which was produced
through a 5-h activation of char with highly concentrated
supercritical steam at 1173 K. This result aligns with our
expectations, considering the high relative volume fraction of
mesopores (64 vol %), moderate volume fraction super-
micropores (34 vol %), negligible relative fraction of ultra-
micropores (2 vol %), and a very small relative fraction of
inaccessible surface area (8%) in the HPSCB-H2O-5h sample
(Table 2). Interestingly, the slopes of the linear segments of our
PFG NMR signal attenuation curves, which correspond to
intrabead self-diffusion of n-hexane, are remarkably similar for
both char and HPSCB-H2O-5h samples (Figure 9, bottom
panels).
The observation that restricted self-diffusion of n-hexane in
both char and HPSCB-H2O-5h pores is quite similar (ηintra = 9.5
and 9.0, respectively, as shown in Figure 9) is noteworthy,
especially when considering the difference in accessible surface
area and accessible pore volume, which are approximately 1507
m2/g and 1.47 cm3/g, respectively (Tables 2 and 3).
Additionally, it is worth highlighting that the intrabead self-
diffusion coefficient of n-hexane in HPSCB-H2O-5h (4.7 ×
10−10 m2/s) is comparable to the intraparticle self-diffusion
coefficients of n-hexane in various porous materials, such as the
NaX zeolite crystal (6.4 × 10−10 m2/s),49 mesoporous silica type
MCM-41 with regular 3.8 nm mesopores (4.1 × 10−10 m2/s),46
and MOF-5 crystal (4.0 × 10−10 m2/s).50
Adsorption Kinetic Performance. The PFG NMR
intrabead n-hexane self-diffusion data offer valuable insights
into the mobility of individual molecules within the pore
networks under equilibrium conditions. Our findings have
shown that a high relative volume fraction of mesopores
enhances the self-diffusion of n-hexane within the pore networks
of hierarchically structured carbon beads (Figure 9). Con-
sequently, we anticipate that the hierarchical pore structure of
the produced carbon beads could potentially improve the

kinetics of ion adsorption from aqueous solutions. In order to
evaluate our hypothesis, we conducted experiments to measure
the adsorption of gold from cyanide solutions onto different
carbon materials: char, HPSCBs activated at 1173 for 5 h, and
the industrial activated carbon Acticarb GC25PAU, which is
commonly employed in the carbon-in-pulp process.
HPSCB-H2O-5h exhibits the fastest kinetics of gold
adsorption, as evidenced by the pseudo-first-order rate constant
of 4.48 × 10−3 1/min (Figure 10 and Table 5). In contrast, the
gold adsorption kinetics in Acticarb GC25PAU is the slowest (k
= 2.89 × 10−3 1/min, Figure 10, and Table 5). This is consistent
with Acticarb GC25PAU having a negligible volume fraction of
accessible mesopores (0.5 vol %) and a negligible fraction of
accessible surface area of mesopores (0.7%) (Figure S12(a)).
Analyzing the experimental results reveals that HPSCB-H2O-5h
achieves a 29% and 41% higher gold uptake compared to the
benchmark Acticarb GC25PAU activated carbon after 60 and
120 minutes, respectively (Figure 10). Both HPSCB-CO2-5h
and HPSCB-CO2/H2O-5h adsorbed the gold cyanide complex
faster than did Acticarb GC25PAU activated carbon. This trend
aligns with the highly obstructed self-diffusion of n-hexane in
Acticarb GC25PAU micropores (ηintra = 40.8 obtained from
Figure 9. Left panels (a, c) show both the experimental (symbols) and theoretical (solid lines) PFG NMR signal attenuation curves of n-hexane

Considering the crucial role of gold cyanide complex
adsorption kinetics in the carbon-in-pulp process,26 it is clear
that the kinetics of gold adsorption by HPSCBs is highly
promising. Columns packed with HPSCB-H2O-5h spherical
carbon beads show significant potential for enhancing the
efficiency of gold recovery. This indicates that HPSCB-H2O-5h
has the potential to significantly enhance the gold extraction
process, making it a valuable asset in gold mining and processing
operations.
The Energy Cost of Steam Generation: USN versus the
Water Heating Process. Figure 11 illustrates the relationship
between the apparent BET surface area of activated carbons
produced through the USN and traditional steam activation at
1173 K, as well as the burnoff degree. In our calculations, we
made use of published data pertaining to three series of activated
carbons. These activated carbons were produced with varying
steam flow rates that originated from the water heating process
(Section 4 in the Supporting Information).51 To maintain
consistency when comparing the energy consumption for steam
generation estimated from both the current experimental data
and previously published results,51 it is crucial to highlight that
all calculations related to the energy cost of steam generation
have been standardized per square meter of the apparent BET
surface area. One of the primary conclusions drawn from our
analysis is that carbon beads, which undergo a 5-h activation
process using USN-generated highly concentrated supercritical

steam at 1173 K, exhibit the highest apparent BET surface area,
measuring 2691 m2/g. This level of surface area is achieved at a
burnoff degree of approximately 79 ± 11 wt % (Figure 11(a)).
The produced spherical carbon beads, averaging 238 ± 1.4 μm
in diameter, exhibit mechanical stability (Table S1). The
activated carbon, resulting from 6 h of traditional steam
activation at 1173 K, achieves its highest apparent BET surface
area of 2130 m2/g at a burnoff of 90 wt % (Figure 11(a)). It is
important to note that this activated carbon is in powder form,
attributed to the disintegration of carbon beads, as reported by
the authors.51
The energy cost of USN and water heating steam generation
for producing high surface area activated carbons (SBET > ∼2000
m2/g) at 1173 K varies significantly. The estimated energy
required for USN steam generation to develop the 1 m2 apparent
BET surface area for HPSCB-H2O-5h is 97 J. On the other hand,
the estimated energy required for water heating steam
generation to develop the 1 m2 apparent BET surface area for
powdered activated carbon with SBET = 2130 m2/g is 190 J
(Figure 11(b)). For activated carbons with SBET around 1000−
1600 m2/g, the energy cost of both USN and water heating
steam generation is similar, approximately ranging from 30 to 50
J/m2. This is evident from the cluster of experimental points
shown in Figure 11(b). These findings consistently demonstrate
that the combustion kinetics and reaction pathways between the
carbon structure and steam at 1173 K are influenced by the
method of steam generation, particularly when the burnoff of
char is high, surpassing approximately 70 wt % as illustrated in
Figure 11.
■CONCLUSIONS
We developed an ultrasonic spray nozzle-quartz tube reactor to
produce hierarchical pore-structured carbon beads (HPSCBs).
Our innovative approach offers several advantages, including
increased energy efficiency per square meter of the apparent
BET surface area, reduced activation time and water
consumption, and improved gold recovery kinetics when
compared to the industrial benchmark. In particular, the
production of high surface area HPSCBs (SBET > ∼2000 m2/
g) using USN-generated highly concentrated supercritical steam
consumes approximately 97 J/m2 for steam generation. In
contrast, the estimated energy cost of steam generation using
traditional steam activation is ∼190 J/m2.
Our study demonstrated that 5 h of activation with USN-
generated highly concentrated supercritical steam at 1173 K
outperforms traditional steam activation. In a previous study,51
which used traditional steam activation at the same temperature
(1173 K), the maximum apparent BET surface area achieved
was 2130 m2/g. However, this process resulted in the breakdown
of spherical carbon beads, producing an activated carbon
powder. In comparison, our innovative reactor design allowed us
to produce the HPSCB-H2O-5h sample with an increased
apparent BET surface area of 2691 m2/g, requiring 1 h less of
activation time, and preserving the structural integrity of the
carbon beads, indicating superior mechanical stability.
Pulse field gradient NMR revealed that the HPSCB-H2O-5h
sample exhibits the fastest intrabead self-diffusivity of n-hexane
at 301 K (ηintra = 9.0) compared to all other carbon samples,
indicating that supermicro- and mesopore clusters are well-
connected. The intrabead self-diffusion of n-hexane in HPSCB-
H2O-5h (4.7 × 10−10 m2/s) is comparable with intraparticle self-
diffusion of n-hexane in the NaX zeolite crystal (6.4 × 10−10 m2/
s),49 mesoporous silica type MCM-41 with regular 3.8 nm
mesopores (4.1 × 10−10 m2/s),46 and MOF-5 crystal (4.0 ×
10−10 m2/s).50 The exceptional intrabead self-diffusion rate of n-
hexane in the HPSCB-H2O-5h sample can be attributed to its
distinct hierarchical pore structure, which predominantly
comprises supermicropores (accessible surface area 53%,
accessible pore volume 34 vol %, Table 2) and mesopores
(accessible surface area 44%, accessible pore volume 64 vol %,
Table 2). The intrabead self-diffusion of n-hexane in char (4.5 ×
10−10 m2/s) is slightly higher compared to HPSCB-H2O-5h, yet
it remains notably rapid. This experimental result can be
attributed to the observation that the hierarchical structure of
char consists of a low fraction of ultramicropores (with an
accessible surface area of 29% and an accessible pore volume of
12 vol %, as presented in Table 2). Furthermore, since
approximately 84% of the total surface area is closed, we
anticipate that all accessible pores are distributed around the
char’s surface, which may enhance the self-diffusion of n-hexane.
To further investigate and confirm our hypothesis, additional
PFG-NMR research employing different probes is necessary.
The kinetic measurements of gold dicyanide recovery clearly
demonstrated that HPSCB-H2O-5h, characterized by inter-
connected supermicroporous and mesoporous regions, is a
superior carbon adsorbent. HPSCB-H2O-5h showed a 29% and
41% higher gold uptake than the benchmark Acticarb
GC25PAU industrial activated carbon after 60 and 120 min.
This underscores the enhanced adsorption kinetics and
efficiency of HPSCB-H2O-5h, making it a promising material
for gold recovery applications.
The implementation of USN-assisted steam activation has led
to a noteworthy decrease in energy demands, allowing for the
production of high-quality carbon beads in a shorter time. The
development of highly concentrated supercritical steam
activation presents an exciting prospect for the sustainable
fabrication of tailored activated carbon featuring adjustable
hierarchical pore architectures and remarkably large surface
areas.
