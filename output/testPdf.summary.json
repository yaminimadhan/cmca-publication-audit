    "ACCESS": "ABSTRACT: This study focuses on enhancing sustainability\nthrough energy-efficient methods in producing hierarchically\nstructured porous carbons. A novel approach, utilizing an ultrasonic\nspray nozzle-quartz tube reactor (USN-QTR), is introduced for\nfabricating carbon beads with customizable ultra-, super-, and\nmesopores. This study showcases noteworthy results from\nsubjecting spherical char particles to activation processes involving\ncarbon dioxide, a mixture of carbon dioxide and micron-sized water\ndroplets, and highly concentrated supercritical steam at a temper-\nature of 1173 K for durations of 3 and 5 h. Through pulse-field\ngradient nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, it was noted\nthat carbon beads produced using USN-generated highly con-\ncentrated supercritical steam displayed remarkably elevated intra-\nbead self-diffusivity of n-hexane. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy demonstrates superior gold recovery\nkinetics from cyanide solutions compared to that from an industrial benchmark. The energy expenditure for USN-generated steam,\nproducing carbon beads with an apparent surface area of 2691 m2/g, is estimated at 97 J per 1 m2 of carbon. This contrasts with the\ntraditional steam generation method requiring approximately the energy of 190 J/m2 for activated carbon with an SBET of 2130 m2/g,\nmaking the USN-assisted activation method a more environmentally friendly and sustainable option with nearly half the energy\nconsumption.\nKEYWORDS: Energy management, ultrasonic spray nozzle, steam activation, hierarchically porous carbon beads,\npulse-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle X-ray scattering",
    "■INTRODUCTION": "applied to green technologies.1−10 One of the critical challenges\nin the production of nanoporous carbons is to achieve high-\nquality nanoporous carbons while minimizing energy con-\nsumption. The traditional energy-intensive activation methods\ndo not align well with green technology.11,12 It is necessary to\ninnovate the production of nanoporous carbons having\ncustomized characteristics with less energy. One promising\napproach to achieve this is by leveraging the capabilities of an\nultrasonic spray nozzle (USN), which has the potential to\nproduce high-quality carbons while reducing energy consump-\ntion.\nUSN technology is an emerging technology that has found\nextensive applications in various fields, including spray coating,\nfabrication of nanoparticles, and synthesis of functional\nnanomaterials and catalysts.13−18 A USN is a low-power\nconsumption device that operates by converting high-frequency\nstanding waves into mechanical energy, which is then transferred\ninto a liquid. USN technology has the potential to accelerate and\nuniform micrometer-sized droplets, which are sprayed directly\ninto a quartz tube reactor without the need for a carrier gas. This\ninnovative approach can lead to the production of high-quality\nnanoporous carbons. The use of USN-aided activation offers\nsignificant advantages over traditional char activation that relies\non a water-heating process conducted outside a reactor to\nproduce steam. The steam is subsequently combined with a\ncarrier gas through a bubbling process and transported to the\nreactor.11 The need to sustain high temperatures for the steam\nentails additional energy consumption to operate ribbon heaters\nReceived:\nJuly 10, 2023\nRevised:\nNovember 23, 2023\nAccepted:\nDecember 6, 2023\nPublished: December 29, 2023\n© 2023 American Chemical Society\n737\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c04171\nACS Sustainable Chem.

Moreover, the utilization of USN-aided\nactivation is suitable for producing nanoporous carbons with\ncustomized pore structures, including hierarchical nanoporous\nactivated carbons.19,20 As far as we are aware, the integration of a\nwater efficiency in the activation process that utilizes steam, it is\nimperative to reduce the costs associated with steam production\nand its transportation. This can be achieved by adopting state-of-\nthe-art USN technology, which offers a promising solution for\nTable 1.

These advantages include high level of chemical\npurity, good fluidity and packaging, a smooth outer surface\ntopology, high mechanical strength, resistance to abrasion and\ndust formation, and the ability to customize surface area and\nporosity to meet specific requirments.20,21 These applications\nencompass a broad range of uses and are not restricted to\nextracorporeal detoxification, hemo- and enterosorption,\nalleviating chemotherapy side effects, extracting precious metals\nfrom low-grade ore through adsorption from cyanide solutions,\nand catalyst support.20−27 To ensure both high chemical purity\nand precise control over the hierarchical pore structure of\ncarbon beads, it is crucial to develop and construct innovative\nnozzle-quartz tube reactor (USN-QTR) for char activation.

The carbon precursor employed consisted of beads of an\nacidic, macroporous cation exchange resin synthesized from a styrene-\ndivinylbenzene copolymer (mean bead size = 670 ± 50 μm, SBET = 15\nm2/g, Vp = 0.144 cm3/g, and an average pore size D = 32.72 nm) and\nsupplied by Lewatit MonoPlus SP 112 H, Lanxess Pty Ltd. (Germany).\nHigh-purity N2 and CO2 gases were procured from BOC Gas\n(Australia). The Reverse Osmosis (4 stages, IBIS Technology,\nAustralia) and Milli-Q Reference Water Purification System were\nused to produce deionized water (18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C).\nThe carbonization process involved taking approximately 2 grams of\nthe polymeric precursor and placing it in a ceramic crucible. The\ncrucible containing the sample was placed into a reactor and then\nheated to a temperature of 803 K for a duration of 2 hours. Nitrogen gas\nwas employed as a carrier gas at a flow rate of around 2.0 dm3/min\n(Figure 1(a)). The result of this carbonization process was\napproximately 82% weight-loss of the precursor, which was determined\nby measuring the sample’s weight before and after carbonization.\nFollowing carbonization, approximately 1 g of the resulting char was\nsubjected to the activation process. The activation method and specific\nparameters used can be found in Table 1 and are schematically shown in\nFigure 1.\nAn ultrasonic cone-shaped spray nozzle operating at 120 kHz (Sono-\nTek Corp., USA) and set to a constant power of 3.0 W was employed\nfor the generation of micrometer-sized water droplets (Figure 1(b)).\nDeionized water was delivered at a constant flow rate of 0.2 cm3/min\nthrough a Teflon tube measuring 0.45 m in length with an inner\ndiameter 0.96 mm, facilitated by a syringe pump. It is important to note\nthat the activation process with highly concentrated supercritical steam\nwas accomplished by continually injecting water droplets generated by\nthe USN directly into the quartz tube reactor without the need for a\ncarrier gas flow (see movies in the Supporting Information). The\nconcentration of supercritical steam was gradually increased in a\ncontrolled manner over 3 and 5 h, as illustrated in the bottom panel of\nFigure 1(c). After 5 h of activation at 1173 K, the estimated density of\nsupercritical steam within the quartz tube reactor is approximately\n0.031 g/cm3.\nloaded into vacuum-tight containers and sealed with 5−7 μm thick mica\nwindows. Each measurement was conducted under a vacuum, with an\nacquisition time of 60 min. Standard reduction software (XSACT) was\nused to average and correct the two-dimensional scattering data to yield\nthe data curves. The 1D SAXS and WAXS data were merged into a\nsingle scattering curve, and the background from the mica windows was\nsubtracted (Figure S1). The theoretical treatment of the SAXS data is\ndescribed in detail in Supporting Information, Section 1. The standard\nX-ray scattering diffraction analysis was conducted using a Rigaku\nSmartLab instrument equipped with a HyPix-3000 detector. The X-ray\nsource used was Cu Kα with a wavelength of 0.154 nm. The analysis\ncovered the angular range 10−90° (2θ) with a step of 0.01° (2θ) and a\nscanning speed of 4°/min. A silicon zero diffraction holder was used for\nthe measurements (Figure S2). The spacing between the graphite layers\nwas determined using the Bragg equation31 (Table S1).\nPFG NMR Diffusion Measurements. For NMR diffusion analysis,\nthe samples were prepared by immersing ∼1.5 g in excess n-hexane\n(>98%, Sigma-Aldrich). These samples were sealed tightly in 5 mm\nNMR tubes (Bruker BioSpin) and left to soak for a minimum of 48 h.\nThe\n1H pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements were\nconducted by using a Magritek Spinsolve Diffusion spectrometer\n(Magritek, New Zealand) equipped with a cylindrical 1 T Halbach\nmagnet array, providing a 1H NMR frequency of 43 MHz. The\nmeasurements were carried out at the default spectrometer temperature\nof 301 K. Before analysis, all samples were allowed to reach thermal\nequilibrium with the magnet bore for at least 20 min.\nThe diffusion of both unrestricted and imbibed n-hexane was\nanalyzed using the pulsed gradient stimulated echo (PGSTE) sequence,\nas depicted in Figure 2.

The porosity of both the char and HPSCBs\nwas evaluated by using nitrogen adsorption−desorption isotherms at 77\nK (Tristar II 3020, Micromeritics, USA). Prior to the measurements,\nthe samples were subject to vacuum degassing at 473 K for 24 h.

A slow-curing transparent epoxy known\nas EpoFix was prepared by combining the resin and hardener in a\nweight ratio of 25:3, respectively. Subsequently, carbon beads were\nintroduced into a 25 mm diameter mounting cup named FixiForm\nalong with the epoxy.

The Acticarb sample used for comparison was selected to\nhave a size fraction in the range of approximately 351−500 μm. This\nchoice was made to ensure that the granules of Acticarb would be\nsimilar in size to those of the produced HPSCBs, facilitating a more\nmeaningful comparison. The carbon was initially ground by using a\nmortar and pestle and then sieved to obtain the desired size fraction. A\ngold standard solution with a concentration of 1 g/dm3 was obtained\nfrom PerkinElmer (Glen Waverley, Vic, AUS). High-purity potassium\ndicyanoaurate(I) (K[Au(Cn)2]), with a purity of 98%, and ACS grade\nPotassium Cyanide (KCN) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich\n(Truganina, Vic, AUS). The measurements using inductively coupled\nplasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) were conducted\nusing a Thermo Scientific iCAP 7000 series instrument, specifically the\nmodel 7600. The ICP-OES spectrometer was operated with the\nfollowing parameters: RF power, 1150 kW; auxiliary gas (Ar) flow, 0.5\ndm3/min; nebulizer gas (Ar) flow, 0.5 dm3/min; exposure time, 15 s;\norientation, axial only; frequency, 500 Hz; replicates, 3.

    "■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION": "morphological changes in HPSCB samples activated at 1173\nK for 5 h. HPSCBs activated at 1173 K for 3 h exhibit a\nmorphology that closely resembles that of char. Figure 3 displays\nsecondary (SE) and backscattered electron (BSE) images of\nchar and HPSCB-H2O-5h. SEM images collected for HPSCB-\nCO2-5h, HPSCB-CO2/H2O-5h, and corresponding energy-\ndispersive X-ray (EDS) spectra are shown in Section 3,\nSupporting Information (Figures S4−S7). The activation\nmethod does not affect the relative concentrations of S, O,\nand C (e.g., S is ∼2.3 ± 0.3 wt %, the content of O is ∼2.1 ± 0.7\nwt %, and C is a dominant element with a relative concentration\nof ∼95.5 ± 0.6 wt %). Notably, microscopic observations\nindicate that each of the carbon beads produced exhibited a rim\nand the core. Discrepancies in characteristics such as porosity,\ndensity, hardness, or permeability between these two regions\nhold intriguing potential for modulating adsorption and\ndesorption kinetics.\nFigures 4 and S8 illustrate the particle size distribution\n(PaSD) derived from the SAXS data. These distributions pertain\nto HPSCB samples activated at 1173 K for 5 (a-c) and 3 h using\nvarious activation methods, as well as char (d). Based on the\ncount and locations of the peaks, we can conclude that both char\nand the produced HPSCB exhibit a distinctive three-level\nhierarchical structure.36−40 The initial prominent symmetrical\npeak at ∼1−10 nm is ascribed to graphene nanoclusters.36−40\nSubsequent WAXS analysis verified the existence of turbostratic\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c04171\nACS Sustainable Chem. Eng. 2024, 12, 737−750\n741\ngraphene clusters, characterized by an average interlayer\ndistance of d002 = 0.411−0.476 nm (Table S1 and Figure S2).\nThe second major peak in the range of about 10−50 nm arises\nfrom coherent scattering by nanoparticles.36−40 The ∼10−40\nnm peak for HPSCB-H2O-5h is broadened rather than a\nsymmetrical bell-shaped one (Figure 4). This suggests that the\nexcessive burnoff of char by highly concentrated supercritical\nsteam may lead to a more uniform distribution of nanoparticle\nsizes. The third level of particulate hierarchy pertains to\naggregates of nanoparticles, with sizes that can be accessed via\nSAXS, reaching up to 500 nm.36−40 On this level, three peaks\nwere discerned, with char exhibiting the highest intensity and\nHPSCB-H2O-5h displaying the lowest. This suggests that the\nactivation method has a relatively minor effect on the structure\nof nanoparticle aggregates.\nAccessible Pore Structure Changes. Figure 5 shows the\nnitrogen adsorption−desorption isotherms measured at 77 K for\nchar and HPSCBs activated at 1173 K for 3 and (a, b) 5 h (c, d).\nThe N2 adsorption−desorption isotherms confirm that all\nsamples have a hierarchical structure of a microporous matrix\nwith embedded mesopore channels. Adsorption in micropores\n(typically smaller 1 nm) at low pressures (p/p0 < 0.1) is\ncharacterized by a sharp concave isotherm of type 1(a),41 while\nadsorption in mesopores is characterized by a well-pronounced\nhysteresis loop at p/p0 > 0.8. The initial part of the isotherm on\nthe HPSCB-H2O-3h sample is of type 1(b) that corresponds to\ncarbons with larger micropores and possible narrow mesopores\n(<2.5 nm). Except for char, the H1-type adsorption−desorption\nhysteresis loops of similar shape are closed at higher relative\npressures with no evidence of cavitation.41,42 The nitrogen\nadsorption−desorption isotherms’ reproducibility was validated\nthrough independent measurements conducted on three\nseparate carbon samples (Figures S9−S11). The adsorption\nand desorption isotherm for char exhibit partial irreversibility at\nlow pressures, suggesting kinetic limitations in the transport of\nnitrogen molecules from the exterior to the pores. Additionally, a\nweak swelling of the char filled with nitrogen is feasible. Detailed\nexamination of the PSD and the contributions of pore volume/\nsurface area from micro- and mesopores (Figures 6−7 and Table\n2) highlights the substantial benefits of USN-assisted activation\nusing highly concentrated supercritical steam. These benefits are\nparticularly evident in terms of the increased accessible surface\narea and porosity.\nThe HPSCP-CO2-3h sample, produced using traditional\nactivation with pure CO2, is characterized by a sharp PSD with\nan ultramicropore (<0.7 nm in width) fraction accounting for\n93% of the accessible surface area, as indicated in Table 2. The\nmesopore volume fraction (ranging from 2 to 50 nm in width),\nat 41 vol % suggests that certain mesopores in the char have been\nopened by CO2. The introduction of micrometer-sized water\ndroplets to the CO2 carrier gas via USN injection leads to\nsignificant changes in PSD, as depicted in Figure 6. The primary\npeak in the PSD at 0.8 nm becomes broader as a result. The\nmajority of the accessible surface area, comprising 78%, can be\nattributed to supermicropores (ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 nm in\nwidth), while the volume fraction of accessible mesopores stands\nat 38 vol % (Table 2). This increase in the fraction of\nsupermicropores can be explained by the merging of ultra-\nmicropore walls and the simultaneous formation of new\nsupermicropores from the early stages of the activation\nprocess.43,44\nThe HPSCB-H2O-3h sample produced through activation\nwith USN-generated highly concentrated supercritical steam,\nshowcases the highest accessible pore volume (0.88 cm3/g) and\naccessible surface area (1272 m2/g). These values are in line\nwith the highest char burnoff observed after 3 h of activation, as\ndetailed in Table 1. The PSD exhibits a broad peak at 0.9 nm,\naccompanied by a distinct shoulder at 1.4 nm. Interestingly, the\nfractions of accessible surface area attributed to ultra-, super-,\nand mesopores closely resemble those of HPSCB-CO2/H2O-3h\n(Table 2).\nAs we will demonstrate later, this outcome can be attributed\nto the relatively short duration of the activation process.\nInterestingly, extending the time of CO2 activation from 3 to 5 h\ndoes not yield significant changes in the PSD or the\ncorresponding fractions of accessible surface area and accessible\npore volume (Figures 6−7 and Table 2). Hence, our conclusion\nis that the traditional 3 and 5 h of CO2 activation of char at 1173\nK is not sufficient for the alteration of the pore structure.\nLikewise, there is no significant alteration in the pore structure\nwhen extending the activation time from 3 to 5 h for carbon\nbeads produced using CO2 enriched with USN-generated\nmicron-sized water droplets.\nIn contrast, subjecting char to 5 h of activation with USN-\ngenerated highly concentrated supercritical steam at 1173 K\nresults in a substantial change in the nitrogen adsorption−\ndesorption isotherm, PSD, and accessible surface/volume ratio\nFigure 5.

The linear shape of nitrogen adsorption isotherm\nfor HPSCB-H2O-5h at very low pressures (∼10−5−10−3 p/p0)\nserves as an indicator of the structural disorder present in the\npore walls (Figure 5).45 The presence of linear segments on the\nnitrogen adsorption isotherm suggests the organization of pores\ninto clusters. Indeed, the PSD calculated for HPSCB-H2O-5h\nreveals the presence of four broad and asymmetric peaks,\nsignifying pore clusters centered at 0.9, 1.8, 3.5, and 18 nm (as\nshown in Figure 6). The substantial accessible pore volume\n(1.88 cm3/g) and accessible surface area (1967 m2/g) of\nHPSCB-H2O-5h were finely tuned. The majority of the\naccessible surface area, at 53%, is attributed to supermicropores,\nfollowed by a 44% contribution from mesopores, while the\ncontribution from ultramicropores is negligible (Table 2). In\nterms of accessible volume, mesopores dominate with a 64 vol %\ncontribution, followed by supermicropores at 34 vol %, and a\nminor 2 vol % contribution from ultramicropores, as shown in\nTable 2.\nOpen and Closed Surface Area Changes. The pore size\ndistributions, extracted from SAXS measurements for char and\nHPSCBs activated at 1173 K for 3 and 5 h using various\nactivation methods (as summarized in Table 1), are presented in\nFigure 8. In all carbon samples produced, SAXS PSD features a\nbroad peak associated with micropores (∼0.4−3.0 nm) and an\nasymmetric peak corresponding to mesopores (∼20−40 nm), in\nagreement with the QSDFT analysis (Figure 6). Furthermore,\nthere are discernible additional contributions from large\nmacropores, ranging from ∼100−200 nm in width. Never-\ntheless, a careful inspection of SAXS PSDs reveals a diminishing\nrelative pore volume associated with these ∼100−200 nm\nmacropores as char burnoff progresses. The enlargement and\ncoalescence of these macropores, likely facilitated by enhanced\ngasification, may account for these observed patterns. It is worth\nnoting that the relative contributions of open (N2-accessible)\nand closed (SAXS data) surface areas are contingent upon both\ntime and the chosen activation method, as detailed in Table 3.\nThe inaccessible surface area of char is notably large, reaching\napproximately 84%. This high level of inaccessibility is due to the\nfact that a significant portion of pores is opened during the\nactivation process.43,44 Traditional activation with CO2 at 1173\nK for 3 to 5 h only manages to open ∼39−41% of the total\nTable 2.

The introduction of ultrasonic spraying of micrometer-\nsized water droplets to CO2 gas promotes the opening of the\nclosed surface area in char. Following 5 h of activation with CO2\ngas enriched with USN-generated water droplets at 1173 K,\napproximately 85% of the total surface area becomes accessible.\nThe most impressive results are achieved with USN-generated\nhighly concerted supercritical steam. After 5 h of activation and\nenhanced gasification of char at 1173 K using this method, the\ncontribution from the accessible surface area increased\nsignificantly to 92% (as outlined in Table 3). Notably, this\nactivation process using USN-generated highly concentrated\nsupercritical steam does not require the addition of a chemical\nactivation agent or a carrier gas flow. Moreover, the water\nconsumption is minimal, totaling 12 cm3 per 60 min of\nactivation.\nIntrabead Transport Properties Changes. Figure 9\npresents the experimental PFG NMR signal attenuation curves\nof n-hexane-saturated char and HPSCBs activated at 1173 K for\n3 (upper panels) and 5 h (bottom panels). Since diffusion rates\nappear to be sufficiently separated (as shown in the left panels of\nFigure 9), we utilized two independent straight lines to describe\nthe diffusion data (as expressed in eq 3).46,47 The initial rapid\ndecay observed is attributed to the unrestricted diffusion of n-\nhexane, which moves quickly between carbon beads (referred to\nas interbead diffusion, Table 4).46 The subsequent portion of the\nattenuation curve reflects the diffusion of n-hexane confined\nstrictly within the pores (intrabead diffusion, Table 4).46 It is\nnoteworthy that the uncertainty values for the PFG NMR\ninteraction parameter, obtained from eq 4, exhibit a range from\napproximately ∼±0.2% to 1.1%.\nThe reduction in n-hexane self-diffusivity within the pores is\nattributed to the limited displacement achievable within the\nconfined carbon nanospaces, as opposed to the more\nunrestricted movement in bulk liquid (ηintra > 1, as shown in\nFigure 9, right panel). The reduced diffusivity of n-hexane can be\nattributed to several factors, including the tortuosity of the pore\nnetwork, adsorption interactions occurring at the pore surface,\nand activated diffusion through pore constrictions.48 Upon\ncomparing PFG NMR signal attenuation curves for n-hexane in\nsaturated char and HPSCB-CO2-3h, it becomes evident that the\nintrabead self-diffusion of n-hexane in these samples is highly\nsimilar, as indicated by the ηintra values of 9.5−9.7 (Table 4).\nThis observation can be rationalized by the notion that char and\nHPSCB-CO2-3h share similar pore structures and pore\naccessibility characteristics, as detailed in Tables 2 and 3.\nSpecifically, a short 3-h activation of char with CO2 at 1173 K\ndoes not lead to substantial alterations in the pore network of the\nchar. Ultrasonic spraying of water droplets onto CO2 gas or\ndirectly into the furnace serves to enhance gasification. As a\nconsequence, there is a substantial increase in the accessible\nporosity, as indicated in Table 2. Hence, self-diffusion of n-\nhexane within the pores of HPSCB-CO2/H2O-3h and HPSCB-\nH2O-3h is notably hindered (Figure 9 upper panels). In the case\nof HPSCB-CO2/H2O-3h, the intrabead self-diffusion parameter\nfor n-hexane is notably high at 21.7, suggesting severe\nrestrictions on the self-diffusion of n-hexane molecules within\nthe pores. However, when USN-assisted activation with highly\nconcentrated supercritical steam is utilized, which encourages\nthe development of open porosity with a substantial fraction of\naccessible surface area and pore volume in the mesopores, the\nintraparticle intrabead self-diffusion parameter for n-hexane is\nreduced to 14.5. This reduction indicates an enhanced\nconnectivity of the hierarchical pore network within HPSCB-\nH2O-3h compared to HPSCB-CO2/H2O-3h.\nThe extended 5-h activation of char with CO2 at 1173 K\nprimarily results in the formation of ultramicropores (Table 2\nand Figures 6-7). As expected, the intrabead self-diffusion of n-\nhexane within this sample is considerably impeded, with an\ninteraction parameter of ηintra of 23.8. The introduction of water\ndroplets into CO2 gas via ultrasonic spraying over a 5-h period\nenhances the self-diffusion of n-hexane within carbon pores,\nresulting in a reduction of the interaction parameter ηintra to 16.7.\nThe highest intrabead diffusivity of n-hexane (ηintra = 9.0) was\nachieved in the HPSCB-H2O-5h sample, which was produced\nthrough a 5-h activation of char with highly concentrated\nsupercritical steam at 1173 K. This result aligns with our\nexpectations, considering the high relative volume fraction of\nmesopores (64 vol %), moderate volume fraction super-\nmicropores (34 vol %), negligible relative fraction of ultra-\nmicropores (2 vol %), and a very small relative fraction of\ninaccessible surface area (8%) in the HPSCB-H2O-5h sample\n(Table 2). Interestingly, the slopes of the linear segments of our\nPFG NMR signal attenuation curves, which correspond to\nintrabead self-diffusion of n-hexane, are remarkably similar for\nboth char and HPSCB-H2O-5h samples (Figure 9, bottom\npanels).\nThe observation that restricted self-diffusion of n-hexane in\nboth char and HPSCB-H2O-5h pores is quite similar (ηintra = 9.5\nand 9.0, respectively, as shown in Figure 9) is noteworthy,\nespecially when considering the difference in accessible surface\narea and accessible pore volume, which are approximately 1507\nm2/g and 1.47 cm3/g, respectively (Tables 2 and 3).\nAdditionally, it is worth highlighting that the intrabead self-\ndiffusion coefficient of n-hexane in HPSCB-H2O-5h (4.7 ×\n10−10 m2/s) is comparable to the intraparticle self-diffusion\ncoefficients of n-hexane in various porous materials, such as the\nNaX zeolite crystal (6.4 × 10−10 m2/s),49 mesoporous silica type\nMCM-41 with regular 3.8 nm mesopores (4.1 × 10−10 m2/s),46\nand MOF-5 crystal (4.0 × 10−10 m2/s).50\nAdsorption Kinetic Performance. The PFG NMR\nintrabead n-hexane self-diffusion data offer valuable insights\ninto the mobility of individual molecules within the pore\nnetworks under equilibrium conditions. Our findings have\nshown that a high relative volume fraction of mesopores\nenhances the self-diffusion of n-hexane within the pore networks\nof hierarchically structured carbon beads (Figure 9). Con-\nsequently, we anticipate that the hierarchical pore structure of\nthe produced carbon beads could potentially improve the\nTable 3.

In order to\nevaluate our hypothesis, we conducted experiments to measure\nthe adsorption of gold from cyanide solutions onto different\ncarbon materials: char, HPSCBs activated at 1173 for 5 h, and\nthe industrial activated carbon Acticarb GC25PAU, which is\ncommonly employed in the carbon-in-pulp process.\nHPSCB-H2O-5h exhibits the fastest kinetics of gold\nadsorption, as evidenced by the pseudo-first-order rate constant\nof 4.48 × 10−3 1/min (Figure 10 and Table 5). In contrast, the\ngold adsorption kinetics in Acticarb GC25PAU is the slowest (k\n= 2.89 × 10−3 1/min, Figure 10, and Table 5). This is consistent\nwith Acticarb GC25PAU having a negligible volume fraction of\naccessible mesopores (0.5 vol %) and a negligible fraction of\naccessible surface area of mesopores (0.7%) (Figure S12(a)).\nAnalyzing the experimental results reveals that HPSCB-H2O-5h\nachieves a 29% and 41% higher gold uptake compared to the\nbenchmark Acticarb GC25PAU activated carbon after 60 and\n120 minutes, respectively (Figure 10). Both HPSCB-CO2-5h\nand HPSCB-CO2/H2O-5h adsorbed the gold cyanide complex\nfaster than did Acticarb GC25PAU activated carbon.

The\nactivated carbon, resulting from 6 h of traditional steam\nactivation at 1173 K, achieves its highest apparent BET surface\narea of 2130 m2/g at a burnoff of 90 wt % (Figure 11(a)).

The estimated energy\nrequired for USN steam generation to develop the 1 m2 apparent\nBET surface area for HPSCB-H2O-5h is 97 J.

The intrabead self-diffusion of n-hexane in char (4.5 ×\n10−10 m2/s) is slightly higher compared to HPSCB-H2O-5h, yet\nit remains notably rapid.

The intrabead self-diffusion of n-hexane in HPSCB-\nH2O-5h (4.7 × 10−10 m2/s) is comparable with intraparticle self-\ndiffusion of n-hexane in the NaX zeolite crystal (6.4 × 10−10 m2/\ns),49 mesoporous silica type MCM-41 with regular 3.8 nm\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c04171.\nSmall-angle X-ray spectrum (SAXS) data treatment for\nanalysis of pore and particle size distributions, SAXS\ndiffraction patterns, X-ray diffraction angle (XRD)\npatterns, description of the procedures for collecting\nand processing pulse-field gradient nuclear magnetic\nresonance (PFG NMR) data, scanning electron micros-\ncopy (SEM) images, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n(EDX) analysis, particle size distributions (PaSD) for\nchar and HPSCB samples activated for 3 h at 1173 K, N2\nadsorption−desorption isotherms at 77 K, PFG NMR\nexperimental results for Acticarb GC25PAU activated\ncarbon, distributions of bead sizes obtained from optical\nmicroscopy, energy calculation for ultrasonic nozzle\nsteam generation (PDF)\nVideo depicting the process of ultrasonic spraying of\nwater droplets into the quartz tube reactor (MP4)\nVideo depicting the process of ultrasonic spraying of\nwater droplets into the quartz tube reactor (MP4)\nVideo depicting the process of ultrasonic spraying of\nwater droplets into the quartz tube reactor (MP4)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c04171\nACS Sustainable Chem.
